    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer. We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the word2vec lesson. You can actually train up an embedding with word2vec and use it here. But it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn the embedding table on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the embedding layer, the new representations will be passed to LSTM cells. These will add recurrent connections to the network so we can include information about the sequence of words in the data. Finally, the LSTM cells will go to a sigmoid output layer here. We're using the sigmoid because we're trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. The output layer will just be a single unit then, with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the very last one, we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the cost from the output of the last step and the training label."

Here we are just defining what the cells look like. This isn't actually building the graph, just defining the type of cells we want in our graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a basic LSTM cell for the graph, you'll want to use `tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell`. Looking at the function documentation:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you can see it takes a parameter called `num_units`, the number of units in the cell, called `lstm_size` in this code. So then, you can write something like \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lstm = tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell(num_units)\n",
    "```\n",

    "to create an LSTM cell with `num_units`. Next, you can add dropout to the cell with `tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper`. This just wraps the cell in another cell, but with dropout added to the inputs and/or outputs. It's a really convenient way to make your network better with almost no effort! So you'd do something like\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, your network will have better performance with more layers. That's sort of the magic of deep learning, adding more layers allows the network to learn really complex relationships. Again, there is a simple way to create multiple layers of LSTM cells with `tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell`:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So the final cell you're using in the network is actually multiple (or just one) LSTM cells with dropout. But it all works the same from an architectural viewpoint, just a more complicated graph in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise:** Below, use `tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell` to create an LSTM cell. Then, add drop out to it with `tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper`. Finally, create multiple LSTM layers with `tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell`.\n",
